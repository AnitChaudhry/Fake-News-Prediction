# Fake-News-Prediction

There are two primary types of fake news:

Linguistic: Contains news in the form of text

Graphic-based: Contains visual data alongside text

With the use of NLP, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), ML models can combine datasets of fake and authentic news to filter misleading information. The exercise sharpens your ideas on the classification matrix, Tfidf Vectorizer, and sophisticated text-cleaning functions.
